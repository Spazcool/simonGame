# freeCodeCamp Simon (ver. 0)

My first go at the game of Simon in JavaScript/jQuery, CSS & HTML as one of the final projects to freeCodeCamp's frontend development program. It's a simple game and I hope you enjoy.

## Getting Started

Host locally after download or check out the one hosted on my site [Simon](http://www.spazcool.com/simon/)

### Prerequisites

A browser and an internet connection is all you'll need.

### Installing

No installation required.

### Version

This game is very much a work in progress with plenty of additions, subtractions, updates and tweaks to come in the near future. 

Still, the basic game is running. Enjoy.
